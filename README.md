In this repository, I will showcase my efforts from my completion of the Data Wrangling with MongoDB course which is apart of the Data Analyst Nanodegree.  In this repository, I will illustrate wrangling data in various formats such as CSV,JSON,XML, and HTML. There will also be code that shows how to audit and clean your data as well storing into a database.  In this case, I will be using MongoDB and using the pymongo package in Python.  The project for this course was to take an area from the OpenStreetMap open-source project and clean up an area of your choice.  I have chosen to clean up the city of Atlanta, GA since this is my hometown.
